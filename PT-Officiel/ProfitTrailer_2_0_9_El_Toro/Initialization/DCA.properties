# -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# DCA is a method for averaging down the price of a losing trade,
# hoping the price will come up to your lower average buy price.
#
# For a more in-depth explanation see here:
#      http://forexop.com/martingale-trading-system-overview
#

# Define the TOTAL amount a single pair is allowed to cost you when using DCA.
#
# Note: use this setting carefully!
# If set to 0 this option is ignored and there is no max cost.
# The bot will keep using DCA until you run out of balance
#
# Example: you set max_cost = 0.01 and you bought 0.005 BTC.
# Because max_cost is 0.01 you are allowed to double up 1 time.
#
# -------------------------------------  WARNING -------------------------------------
#
# Using the Martingale strategy your trade exposure on a losing sequence increases exponentially.
# Remember that each time ANDEERSON DCA makes a buy it will double your current quantity of that pair.
# That means it has the potential to use your entire trading budget, therefore, you MUST consider using a low
# DEFAULT_DCA_max_cost.
#
# We also need to avoid the Taleb dilema https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taleb_distribution
# which states the greater your drawdown limit, the lower your probability of making a loss ? but the bigger that loss will be.
# So we therefore have put other protection mechanisms throughout the settings to ensure we pick good pairs and minimise loss.
# None of these can guarantee that you will be safe so heed this warning and adjust the below value to suit your trading style.

#             EL TORO - BUY STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.0.6 to 2.0.9
#
# El Toro is an agressive scalping strategy that works in all market conditions.
# The Buy strategy makes use of the DEFAULT_buy_min_change_percentage to
# look for pairs that have lost 5% in the last 24 hours. It then looks for a
# buy signal within the last hour using an EMACROSS of 8/13. It then looks
# for an opportunity to buy a small dip in the price using a negative EMAGAIN
# pick pairs at the bottom of their trade cycle. It uses RSI to confirm we
# are at the bottom of the trade cycle to ensure we buy the dip. Finally it
# trails the price to ensure we get the best buy.
# It also employs the take profit
# DEFAULT_take_profit_percentage settings to sell if we are at 2% profit
# or better but havent sold in over 10 minutes (2 candles) allowing for a half
# a percent threshold. If we exceed that threshold the 10 minute countdown resets.
#
# This strategy works best in a Bull market, but will work in a bear or sideways
# market just much slower as volatility will be low in those markets.

#             EL TORO - SELL STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.0.6 to 2.0.9
#
# El Toro is an agressive scalping strategy that works in all market conditions.
# The sell strategy employs the take profit DEFAULT_take_profit_percentage
# settings to sell if we are at 1% profit or better but havent sold in over
# 10 minutes (2 candles) allowing for a half a percent threshold. If we exceed
# that threshold the 10 minute countdown resets. It uses both the GAIN and
# RSI indicators to sell as soon as the current price goes above the GAIN threshold
# you set. It uses RSI to confirm we are at the top of the trade cycle to ensure we
# sell at the peak. It uses a low GAIN and DEFAULT_trailing_profit percentage
# to scalp profits as quickly as possible.
#
# This strategy works best in a Bull market, will work in a bear or sideways
# market just much slower as volatility will be low in those markets.
#
#                        RUN WITH THE BULLS

# This strategy employs the classic scalping or jobbing strategy using the HIGHBB, GAIN and

# you set. HIGHBB is used to maximise the profits ensuring we are in the high band range at
# the peak of the Trade Cycle. It uses RSI to confirm we are trending up towards the top of
# the trade cycle to ensure we sell at the peak.
# It uses a higher GAIN percentage than the Pairs log in order to maximise DCA pair profits.
