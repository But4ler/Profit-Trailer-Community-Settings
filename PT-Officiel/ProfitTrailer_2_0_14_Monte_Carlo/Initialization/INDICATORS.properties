#                    Bollinger Bands (BB) settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Bollinger bands are a good indicator of if a pair is currently undersold or oversold.
# The bands are used to gauge how high or low prices are relative to previous prices.
# Bollinger Bands are based on a moving average - typically, 20 periods - with upper and
# lower bands two standard deviations above and below the moving average.
# The bands should contain about 95% of all price points with around 5% anomolies that
# exceed bands limits. Bollinger Bands indicate a market's volatility and can indicate
# market conditions for determining whether the market is likely to move up, down or
# sideways. When volatility is rising, the distance between the upper and lower bands
# will expand. When volatility is low, the distance between the bands contracts.
# If the distance between the bands becomes unusually wide, it may indicate that the
# current trend is reaching its end. if the distance between the bands become narrow
# it may indicate an imminent breakout.

# Define the SMA time frame (in candles) used by all BB calculation of ProfitTrailer.
# BITTREX specific timing, needs to be adjusted per exchange.
#
# Do this by adding a BB to a chart for a pair and look at the BB properties.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Stochastic refers to the point of a current price in relation to its
# price range over a period of time. The stochastic oscillator is a momentum
# indicator that uses support and resistance levels. The Stochastic Oscillator
# formula is applied to a set of Relative Strength Index (RSI) values rather
# than standard price data. Using RSI values within the Stochastic formula
# gives traders an idea of whether the current RSI value is overbought or oversold.

# Define the period (in seconds) used to calculate the STOCH.

# The Stochastic  Oscillator (STOCH) is range bound between 0 and 100. 
# Both K and D represent lines on a price action chart. 
# The first line (known as K) displays the current close (ie. the percentage of the 
# price at closing)  in relation to the price range (high/low) along the number of 
# candles used to look back along the price action chart. 
STOCH_K = 1

# The second line (known as D) is a simple moving average of the first line, typically
# based on the last three candle periods for smoothing . STOCH RSI on the other hand 
# is a combination of indicators (STOCH and RS) each with their own separate calculations.  
# STOCH RSI is completely dependent upon having worked out an RSI value first. 
# The RS Indicator represents the relative strength or weakness of prices over a period 
# of time and is range bound between 0 and 100, 0 being the weakest point. It is derived 
# by looking at the average gain over a period of days vs the average loss of the same period.
# RSI and STOCH RSI should never be used stand alone as you can get false positives in that 
# indicator, they need to be combined with other indicators to confirm the trends they are 
# showing. i.e. combine with LOWBB to confirm a downtrend.
