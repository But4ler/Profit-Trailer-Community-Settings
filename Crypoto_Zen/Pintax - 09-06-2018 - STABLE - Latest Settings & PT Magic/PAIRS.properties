#to get buys during a very bullish day, you -may- want to manually activate strategies shown in the -next- strategy section.
#use EMAGAIN or LOWBB (but -not- both). Use RSI if needed (but this is not recommended).

#RSI: buy zone begins when RSI value is between (or equal to) 5-42.
#this avoids buying 'sudden droppers' at a high price (it buys them, but much lower)
#downside: eliminates -a lot- of good calls too. NOT recommended. Use for extra safety if needed.
#ex: DEFAULT_A_buy_value = 20  buy zone begins when RSI value is less than/equal to 20. DEFAULT_A_buy_value_limit must be less than 20 if used.

#downside: may prevent us from buying something cheap, so needs correct number
#downside 2: may even get us to rebuy that dropping coin at a higher price (but it might be ok as it is bouncing)

#LOWBB Positive (safer than emagain): Buys right when it bounces. More buys than LOWBB Negative.
